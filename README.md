# Welcome!

Hi! My name is Rishi Prasadha. I have a cumulative total of 3-5 years of coding experience spread out across many different languages, but primarily Java, Matlab and Python. Most recently I dove deep into ML and data science with Python and I was 'hooked'. As of the writing of this Markdown, I am working for a startup and I am intrigued by app development. So WELCOME! This is my journey to learn the Django framework. If you feel inclined, please reach out -- I'd love to chat!
